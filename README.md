https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-markdown-previewer

1. **Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/.

2. **Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

3. **Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

4. **Rule #3**: You must use both Sass and React to build this project.

5. **User Story**: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

6. **User Story**: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

7. **Hint**: You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked

8. **Note**: If you want to use the React JSX syntax, you need to enable 'Babel' as a preprocessor
